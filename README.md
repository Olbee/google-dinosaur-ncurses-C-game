# google-dinosaur-ncurses-game-on-C

This marks my inaugural venture into C programming, presenting a console game crafted in December 2021.
While I acknowledge that the code may not be stellar, I consider it a commendable attempt at enhancing the renowned Google Dinosaur Game.

Check out the documentation file for detailed gameplay info.

To compile the code, just use this command:
gcc -std=c11 -Wall -Werror -g main.c -lm -o main."
