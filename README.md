# google-dinosaur-ncurses-game-on-C

This is my first project on C.
This is a console game released in December 2021.

Terrible code, even for the first experience.
But, as for me, a good idea of improvement on the well-known Google Dinosaur Game.

All information about the gameplay can be found in the documentation file.

to compile: gcc -std=c11 -Wall -Werror -g    main.c  -lm -o main
