# google-dinosaur-ncurses-game-on-C

This is my first project in C.
This is a console game, which was created in December 2021.

It has a terrible code, even for a first-time experience.
However, as for me, it's a good idea of improving the famous Google Dinosaur Game.

For detailed information about the gameplay, please refer to the documentation file.

To compile the code, please use the following command:
gcc -std=c11 -Wall -Werror -g    main.c  -lm -o main
